# PhysAgent (The code is continuously updated)
PhysAgent: An LLM-driven multi-agent framework for autonomous physics research workflows, enabling end-to-end scientific discovery from hypothesis generation to computational modeling and data analysis. Integrates physics-based simulations with advanced AI reasoning for interpretable and reproducible results.

## ðŸ§  Core Functionalities of PhysAgent

* **Learning**
  The agent improves its task performance through interaction with the environment, receiving feedback, and adapting strategies based on experience.

* **Reasoning**
  The agent utilizes existing knowledge to derive conclusions or strategies via logical inference, deduction, or heuristics for scientific problem-solving.

* **Memory**
  The agent stores and retrieves past experiences, knowledge, and contextual information to assist future tasks.

* **Reward**
  Feedback signals provided to the agent for task completion. These signals guide learning, policy updates, and behavior optimization.

* **Perception**
  The agent perceives environmental states through sensors or interfaces, serving as the foundation for reasoning and action.

* **Action**
  The agent performs specific behaviors or operations based on perception and internal reasoning to achieve defined goals.

## ðŸ¤– Role Allocation in PhysAgent System

* **Human User**
  Defines scientific problems and provides experimental data.

* **Mentor Agent**
  Guides the exploration process using Socratic questioning and mitigates bias in hypothesis generation.

* **Student Agent**
  Executes numerical simulations, implements code, and resolves technical challenges.

* **Leader Agent**
  Coordinates task distribution and dynamically allocates computational or agent resources for efficient execution.
